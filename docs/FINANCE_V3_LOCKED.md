# Finance Engine — V3_LOCKED (Deterministic)

## Principles
- No technical analysis (TA)
- No hype / sentiment / narratives
- No invented metrics
- Missing KPI = UNKNOWN
- UNKNOWN is penalized conservatively
- Scores are stored as "score runs" (not computed ad hoc per page load)

## Required Outputs (per ticker/security)
- Component scores
- Final score + action label
- Buy-at/under trigger price
- Valuation bands (low/base/high) + expected value
- Guardrail flags
- Unknown count + penalty applied indicator
